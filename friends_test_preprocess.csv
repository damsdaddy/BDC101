99|Joey|theres just so much pressure.|7|2020100
100|Joey|i mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different.|0|3000002
101|Joey|i dont know if youd understand.|0|4010000
102|Ross|yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.|0|3000101
103|Rachel|well phoebe, we gotta do something!|7|0102011

111|Monica|ross, we can handle this.|0|5000000
112|Ross|well, apparently not, and i cant just stand by and watch two people i care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly.|2|0030101
113|Ross|i mean, enough of the silliness!|4|0000401
114|Chandler|well, why dont you tell her to stop being silly!|4|0000410
115|Ross|okay-okay!|7|1001021
116|Ross|two very good points, look ive known you both a long time, and ive never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as youve been since youve got together.|7|2011010
117|Ross|do you really want to throw that all away over a room?|7|2011010
118|Ross|that is so silly.|7|2010002
119|Ross|now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?|0|3020000
120|Chandler|well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.|0|3110000
121|Monica|love is the best medicine.|1|1310000
122|Chandler|thats laughter.|7|2200001
123|Monica|why do you do it?|0|3010010
124|Chandler|i dont know.|0|3010010

133|Phoebe|you're not? see, that's why you're so great!|5|0200030
134|Roger|actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.|0|3000002
135|Roger|y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, i'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'oh, define me!|7|1100102
136|Roger|define me!|7|1000202
137|Roger|love me, i need love!|7|2010002

160|Joey|listen uh, id prefer it if you didnt call me joey.|0|4001000

162|A Waiter|hey, dragon! heres your tips from monday and tuesday.|0|3100010
163|Joey|theres like-theres like 300 bucks in this one!|5|0000050

166|Monica|could the waiters gather around to hear tonights specials?|0|3000011
167|Monica|okay, first there is a chilean sea bass prepared with a mango relish on a bagwhy is nobody writing these down?|7|2000111
168|The Waiter|because we can remember them.|0|4000100
169|Monica|because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?|7|1001210
170|Ross|hey. when you guys were kids and you played|0|5000000
171|Monica|i was always joanne.|0|5000000

177|Chandler|what a wank!|4|0000401
178|Janice|oh, i cannot believe hes using our divorce to sell mattresses.|4|0000320
179|Monica|i know!|7|2000120
180|Monica|and four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves.|7|2100011
181|Monica|and im appalled for you by the way.|7|1010102
182|Rachel|you had to do it, didnt you? you couldnt just leave it alone.|7|2000201

195|Ross|look, honey, i have tried to make nice, it doesnt work.|7|2010002
196|Rachel|okay, look, ross, i realise that my father is difficult, but thats why you have got to be the bigger man here.|0|4000100
197|Ross|look sweetie, i could be the bigger man, i could be the biggest man, i could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldnt make any difference, except that i could pick your father up and say like me!|7|1000202
198|Ross|like me tiny doctor!|7|1000211
199|Rachel|okay, well cant you just try it one more time ross? for me? for me?|7|1121000

201|Rachel|okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay.|4|1000301

1130|Dana|absolutely! but you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?|5|1000040
1131|Chandler|well, the heart wants what it wants. ill see you later.|0|4000001
1132|Monica|okay, i got that. ill escape over there. ill come back over here. all right, come on|0|5000000
1133|Phoebe|hey, you guys. listen, im sorry that i was hogging the game beforeoh my god! your friends have some unfortunate initials!|7|2001011
1134|Monica|theyre all chandler.|0|4000010
1135|Phoebe|chandler sucks! he couldnt have gotten this good!|5|2000030
1136|Chandler|i did.  but it came at a price.|0|4010000
1137|Monica|but ben is coming over tonight and he cant see this.|3|2003000
1138|Chandler|oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies.  was it just me?!|5|1000040
1139|Chandler|sure!|1|0400010
1140|Monica|okay, i was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right?|0|3200000
1141|Monica|with a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time!|1|0500000
1142|Monica|and we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!!|1|0500000
1143|Monica|okay, whatever, i really havent thought about it that much.|0|4010000
1144|Chandler|well, i like that idea.|1|2300000
1145|Chandler|obviously!|1|1300001
1146|Chandler|i was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, yknow?|0|3101000
1147|Chandler|i mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like|0|4001000
1149|Chandler|"okay so you mean no as in, ""gee chandler, what an interesting idea. lets discuss it before we reject it completely."""|7|1001201
1150|Monica|oh, im sorry. of course i mean that. interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.|6|1000004
1151|Chandler|so, thats it?|5|1000031
1152|Monica|i just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. the beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.|0|3000101
1153|Chandler|which is why|0|4001000
1154|Monica|what do you have against the beautiful guest room?|4|1000310
1155|Chandler|i dont have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!|7|1100102
1156|Monica|are you mocking me?|7|1000211
1157|Chandler|no, im not mocking you,  or you beautiful guest room.|0|4000001
1158|Monica|y'know, i love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!|1|0500000

1162|Monica|yes! you are so smart!  i love you.|1|0500000
1163|Joey|i love you too.|1|0500000
1164|Chandler|i never sucked, i actually didn't want you to know how good i was!|7|2000210
1167|Monica|this is so great! now we can enter into doubles tournaments!|1|0500000
1168|Chandler|that's|0|5000000
1170|Monica|hey. okay, i gave him another chance, but tim has|0|4010000
1171|Phoebe|but|0|4001000
1172|Monica|"no! no-no! he is totally incompetent. i called the chef who recommended him to me. he said, ""ha-ha! gotcha!"""|6|0000203
1173|Phoebe|okay. okay, but you cant fire him today.|0|4001000
1174|Monica|why not?!|7|1000220
1175|Phoebe|because im dumping him today.|7|2010101
1176|Monica|what?! you said he was sweet!|5|0000050
1177|Phoebe|he|0|5000000
1178|Monica|just dont pick up your phone.|0|4001000
1179|Phoebe|"then he comes over!  ""im so worried about you."" uck! be a man!"|6|0001004
1180|Monica|what? so now im not allowed to fire him?|5|0000050
1181|Phoebe|you cant fire him and dump him the same day, hell kill himself.|7|0022001
1182|Monica|okay well then, ill fire him today and you go out with him for another week.|0|4000001
1183|Phoebe|are you kidding?! another week with that sip, ill kill|6|0000113
1184|Monica|okay well, then well both do it today and hell just have to deal with it!|0|3000200
1185|Phoebe|okay. but the question is whos gonna go first. cause whoever goes second is the bitch.|7|2002010
1186|Phoebe|really? thats the thing im worse at! youll see.|7|2001020
1187|Ticket Counter Attendant|this is the final boarding call for flight 664 to yemen.|0|5000000

1465|Phoebe|um, can you roll your tongue?|0|5000000

1472|Chandler|do we have any... do we have any thoughts here?|0|5000000
1473|Joey|well, i've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as i understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right.|0|5000000
1474|Joey|but, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear.|0|5000000
1475|Joey|it have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building!|3|0103010
1476|Joey|if you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.|0|5000000
1478|Joey|in this case, you have a fear of commitment, so i say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.|0|4100000
1479|Rachel|amazingly, that makes sense.|7|2200010
1480|Chandler|you think?|0|4000010

1522|Chandler|because uhwe-wewe split up. monica and i split up. hold me.|2|0050000
1523|Doug|good god bing iwell i cant say im altogether surprised, i saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.|7|1010021
1524|Doug|and the way she looked at me, pure lust.|1|1400000

1578|Mike|do|0|5000000
1579|Monica|ah,|0|4000010
1582|Mike|do you?|7|2000120
1583|Ross|yknow i dont understand why they didnt cry. it was a beautiful speech.|7|0201020
1584|Monica|oh, come on.|6|0000203
1586|Ross|all that stuff you said about true love, you were right, i mean, we did learn a lot from mom and dad!|1|1300010
1587|Ross|and that picture of chi-chi with her mischievous grin.|0|3200000
1588|Ross|and what you said about nana.|0|4100000
1589|Ross|ohh, yeah she really wouldve wanted to be there.|7|2210000

1592|Monica|oh good god, ross! how the hell do you do it?|5|0000050
1593|Joey|you forget how many great songs heart had.|0|5000000
1595|Ross|you know, barracuda was the first song i learned to play on the keyboard.|0|5000000
1596|Chandler|so, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.|7|2000012
1597|Joey|oh, you guys, with this joke. i gotta say, i know i cracked up, but im not even sure i got it.|0|3200000
1598|Ross|what, you didnt get it? the doctor is a monkey.|0|3000020
1599|Chandler|and monkeys cant write out prescriptions.|0|5000000
1600|Chandler|you are not allowed to laugh at my joke.|7|2000210
1601|Ross|your joke? well, i think the hef would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.|0|3000110
1602|Monica|i cant find garbage bags!|4|0000410
1603|Rachel|oh, i think i saw some in here.|0|4000010
1604|Monica|what is it?!|5|0002030
1605|Rachel|i dont know! but maybe if we keep that drawer shut, itll die.|6|0002003
1606|Monica|i cant believe were living here!|7|0100121
1607|Chandler|you still haven’t told rachel you weren’t really  proposing?|5|1000040
1608|Joey|no! she had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she  took her breast out.|7|1120010
1609|Chandler|joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! and what did it  look like?!|5|0100040
1610|Joey|i didn’t look at it. stupid baby’s head was blocking most of  it.|7|2010110
1611|Chandler|go and tell rachel right now before ross finds out.|7|1100201
1612|Joey|look, it’s not that easy. she said she wanted to marry me. i  don’t want to hurt her.|2|1040000
1613|Chandler|okay, look, just do it gently.|0|4010000
1614|Joey|you’re right.|0|3020000
1616|Joey|i-i’ll go tell her now before ross  finds out and i’ll be gentle.|0|3020000
1617|Joey|i can do that.|0|4010000
1618|Joey|i am a gentle person.|0|4010000
1619|Joey|oh, by the  way.|0|5000000
1620|Joey|two people screwing in there  if you want to check that out.|0|4000010
1621|Rachel|hi, pheebs?|0|5000000
1622|Rachel|okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.|0|3020000
1624|Phoebe|okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between cathy and heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in england.|7|2011001
1625|Phoebe|which|0|4000100
1626|The Teacher|how would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , rachel green?|0|4000010
1627|Rachel|umm, well i would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.|0|3011000
1628|The Teacher|well, that's sort of a given, but yes. anyone else?|0|5000000
1629|Rachel|oh-oh-oh, symbolism! and uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which|1|1300010

1632|Rachel|well, honey that was pretty obvious.|7|2000201
1633|Phoebe|well how would you know?! you didn't even read it!|4|0000500
1634|The Teacher|what do you think? you in the blue shirt.|0|5000000
1635|Phoebe|i think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.|0|5000000
1636|The Teacher|would ya care to venture one?|0|3000101
1637|Phoebe|would|0|4000010
1638|The Teacher|are you just repeating what i'm saying?|4|1000310

1989|Rachel|yknow, i know that i said that i am totally okay with ross getting married, but as it turns out, i dont think im handling it all that well.|2|0050000

2091|Monica|we said six!|4|0000410
2092|Chandler|the only way that i said six would be if the sevens, let meet at seven, not at six.|0|3000101
2093|Monica|"yeah and if i had seven, maybe i wouldve said something like this, ""wow! my boyfriends such a wise assseven!"""|4|0000302

2109|Janice|oh please.|0|4010000
2110|Janice|every moment is precious.|7|2210000
2112|Janice|besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends dont really seem to care too much that youre leaving.|7|1120001
2113|Chandler|well, were really not that close.  okay, so i guess this is uh, good-bye then.|0|3020000
2114|Janice|on no! no! its not good-bye, im not leaving until you get on that plane.|7|0110120
2115|Chandler|no, im afraid i wont be able to make love as well as him.|7|2021000
2116|Ross|yeah, i was going for the metaphor.|0|4000001
2117|Chandler|yes, and i was saying the actual words.|0|4000001
2118|Monica|so big deal, so joeys had a lot of girlfriends, it doesnt mean hes great in bed.|0|3000200
2119|Chandler|we share a wall! so either hes great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.|0|4000010
2120|Monica|sweetie, with you its gonna be different. the sex is gonna be great, cause you-you guys are in love.|1|1300010

2222|Rachel|although yknow, he-hes a private guy.|7|2021000
2223|Rachel|yknow, i wish i could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.|2|2030000
2224|Phoebe|thats easy! you just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that wont open.|0|4100000
2225|Rachel|so what are you saying; i should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?|5|2000030
2226|Phoebe|no thats what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.|0|4100000
2227|Paul|hi honey.|0|3200000
2229|Monica|okay, ben, i wont tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you dont tell about our little bonking incident.|3|2003000

2236|Rachel|okay, fine.|0|4000100
2237|Rachel|gunther, y'know what, i am a terrible waitress, do you know why im a terrible waitress?|7|2010002
2238|Rachel|because, i dont care.|0|3010100
2239|Rachel|i dont care.|0|3020000
2240|Rachel|i dont care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, i dont care where the tray spot is, i just dont care, this is not what i want to do.|7|1010102
2241|Rachel|so i dont think i should do it anymore.|7|2020001
2242|Rachel|im gonna give you my weeks notice.|7|2010101
2244|Rachel|gunther, i quit.|7|2010101
2245|Chandler|does this mean were gonna have to start paying for coffee?|5|0001040

2695|Monica|don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.|0|4000001
2696|Doctor Connelly|ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.|0|4001000
2698|Ross|well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. i mean, anthropologically speaking-|0|5000000
