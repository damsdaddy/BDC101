1120|Phoebe|okay, i will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. i just dont know what the big deal is!|4|0000410
1121|Ross|the big deal is i dont want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when i want to kick back with a puzzlebeer! cold beer.|7|0100202
1122|Ross|okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?|0|3002000

1454|Chandler|what rule? there's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!|4|0000500
1455|Joey|how'd you get to that?|7|2000120
1456|Chandler|well, i believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with angela delvecchio|7|2000102
1457|Joey|you knew about that?|5|0000050
1458|Chandler|well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.|6|1000004
1459|Joey|ok, ok, how about if we split it?|0|5000000
1460|Chandler|what do you mean, like, buy it together?|7|2000021

1465|Joey|why, are you moving out?|7|2002010
1466|Chandler|i'm not moving out.|0|5000000

1469|Joey|aw, i know all about kip!|7|1110002
1470|Chandler|it's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.|7|2010002
1471|Joey|well, let me ask you something, was kip a better roommate than me?|7|2001011
1472|Chandler|aw, don't do that|7|0020111

1488|Ross|okay, look, how is this gonna affect you?|0|3101000

1497|Rachel|you are asking me to be your wife!|7|1100120
1498|Ross|and as my wife i think you should grant me this favor.|0|3200000
1500|Paul|i know, i know, i'm such an idiot.|7|1010102

2533|Monica|chandler! phoebes hogging the game!|4|0000500
2534|Rachel|remember i had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?|0|4000001
2535|Joey|yeah. but i thought that was because i put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.|0|3100010
2536|Monica|anyway, it just doesnt seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. okay? its a lot of work.|0|4000001
2537|Joey|but you gotta have turkey on thanksgiving!|7|2010110
2538|Joey|i mean, thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like fourth of july with no apple pie!|7|2020100
2539|Joey|or friday with no two pizzas!|7|2020100
2540|Monica|all right fine! if it means that much to you! but justtheres gonna be a ton left over.|7|2000201
2541|Joey|no there wont! i promise i will finish that turkey!|1|1400000
2542|Monica|all right, youre telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?|7|2100020
2544|Joey|cause im a tribbiani!|1|1400000
2545|Joey|and this is what we do!|0|3200000
2546|Joey|i mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we dont read a lot or run very fast, but damnit!|7|2200100
2547|Joey|we can eat!|1|0400100
2549|Phoebe|wow! it's huge! it's so much bigger than the cubicle. oh, this is a cube.|5|1100030
2550|Chandler|look at this!|1|0300020
2551|Phoebe|oh! you have a window!|5|0200030

2563|Ross|oke-dokey.|0|4000001
2564|Ross|where exactly is your zoo?|0|4000010
2565|Dr. Baldhara|well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience.|0|4001000
2566|Dr. Baldhara|let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, marcel?|0|5000000
2568|Dr. Baldhara|does he, uh, fight with other animals?|0|3001010
2569|Ross|no-no, he's, he's very docile.|7|1110020
2570|Dr. Baldhara|even if he were... cornered?|0|4001000
2571|Ross|well i, i don't know. why?|0|3000020
2572|Dr. Baldhara|uh, how is he at handling small objects?|0|4001000
2573|Ross|he can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...|7|2100011
2574|Dr. Baldhara|how about a hammer, or a small blade?|0|3002000
2575|Ross|why- why- why would he need a blade?|7|0002120
2576|Dr. Baldhara|well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something.|7|2001020
2577|Dr. Baldhara|otherwise it's just cruel.|0|3011000
2578|Joey|he- he- he got in, he- he got in to san diego.|1|1300010
2579|Joey|we, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...|0|3200000

2581|Ross|he's in! oh, did you hear that, marcel? san diego. san diego!|1|0300020
2582|Dr. Baldhara|you're making a big mistake here.|6|2000003
2583|Dr. Baldhara|i mean, san diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, i'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.|0|4000001
2584|Chandler|my specimen is in the    room and i just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while i was in there.|7|0200201

3643|Ross|pheebs, come on, you didnt kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist.|0|3000020

4500|Julie|oh my god, are you kidding?|5|1000040

4502|Rachel|well, you're not totally paranoid.|0|3000011
4503|Julie|oy.|7|2010020

6017|Phoebe|cause youre still into monica.|0|5000000
6018|Phoebe|so you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...|0|4010000

6072|Alice|is that it, is that what it is?|7|1010021

6075|Phoebe|none the less.|0|3020000
6076|Alice|none the less. umm, youre too young to, to really know what you want.|2|1030010

6168|Chandler|hey, this is so unfair!|4|0010301
6169|Monica|oh, why is it unfair?|5|1000031
6170|Chandler|so i have a flaw!|7|0000212
6171|Chandler|big deal!|4|0000311
6172|Chandler|like joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?|7|1000202
6173|Chandler|and ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?|7|1000202
6174|Chandler|and monica, with that snort when she laughs?|7|1000202
6175|Chandler|i mean, what the hell is that thing?|6|1000103
6176|Chandler|...i accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?|7|1010111
6177|Joey|...does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?|7|2000021
6178|Rachel|well, i-i could live without it.|0|4001000
6179|Joey|well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when phoebe chews her hair?|7|2000012
6180|Ross|oh, now, don't listen to him, pheebs, i think it's endearing.|0|5000000
6181|Joey|"oh,  ""you do, do you""?"|4|0000320
6182|Ross|you know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.|0|4000100
6183|Rachel|"""indeed there isn't""... i should really get back to work."|7|2000201
6184|Phoebe|yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.|0|3000101
6185|Rachel|ohh-ho-hooohhh. the hair comes out, and the gloves come on.|4|1000310
6186|Joey|awww! mel torme died.|2|0040010

6191|Phoebe|you're sure? you're absolutely sure?|0|3000020
6192|Monica|well, no. but, um, i bet she probably does.|0|4000010
6193|Phoebe|probably?|0|3000011
6194|Phoebe|yeah, i don't like that word.|6|1000004
6195|Phoebe|kind of what probably really means.|0|4000001
6196|Phoebe|yeah, uh-huh.|0|4000001
6197|Phoebe|"yeah, oh, ""your mom probably won't kill herself,"" yknow?"|7|2010110
6198|Phoebe|"i'm sorry, but i'm not hanging all my hopes of rachel and i living together on-on ""probably!"""|7|1021100
6200|Phoebe|you gotta take care of yourselves!|0|4001000
6201|Phoebe|in|0|5000000
6202|Chandler|bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?|0|3000020

6206|Rachel|oh, im fine.|0|5000000
6207|Janice|can i just say, i really admire what youre doing. just raising her all alone.|0|3200000
6208|Rachel|oh, im not doing it alone. i have ross.|0|4000010
6209|Janice|oh, sure. now. but what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?|0|4000001
6210|Rachel|well then he gets a divorce, its ross!|0|3001001
6211|Janice|im telling you rachel, listen to janice. they all say theyre gonna be there until they start their real family.|0|3001100
6212|Rachel|well ithats never gonna happen with ross.|7|2000201
6213|Janice|oh well thats what i thought about my first husband, now im lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little ms. new boobs.|6|2000003
6215|Phoebe|and tim i just wanna say, good luck here.|0|3000002
6216|Ross|hey. whos that?|0|4000010

6221|Rachel|right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery.|0|4010000
6222|Rachel|oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little jamie just crowning away.|0|3100010
6223|Ross|wow! sorry. so uh, how are the new people?|5|2000030
6226|Rachel|look at that guy by the window, wow!|5|2000030
6227|Phoebe|hes awfully short and i think hes talking to himself. and to be completely honest, hes not that good in bed.|0|4010000
6228|Rachel|oh, what is wrong with me lately?|2|1030010
6229|Rachel|i mean its like every guy i seei mean look here.|0|4010000
6230|Rachel|look at that guy for example, i mean normally thats not someone i would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way im feeling, all i want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.|7|2110100
6231|Phoebe|wait a second! this is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?|0|4000010
6233|Phoebe|this is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.|0|5000000
6234|Rachel|really?! so this has happened to you?|5|0000050
6235|Phoebe|oh absolutely yeah!|0|4000010
6236|Phoebe|oh and keep in mind, now, i was carrying triplets so in, yknow, medical terms i was-i was thrice as randy.|0|5000000

6254|Ross|that ring? when my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.|5|1010030
6255|Chandler|so you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?|5|1010030
6256|Ross|oh absolutely! it has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.|1|0400010
6257|Chandler|so you might say, its a magic ring.|7|2200010
6258|Ross|oh my god!! i didnt really believe it until you just said it!!|5|0200030
6259|Ross|well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.|0|3000200
6260|Joey|obviously! so, how do we decide?|0|4001000
6261|Ross|well now lets-lets look at this objectively, i think i should date her|0|3101000
6262|Joey|uh-huh. uh-huh.|0|4000100
6263|Ross|thats interesting, but check this out. i date her|7|1200200

6265|Ross|okay, okay. this can go on for a while.|0|5000000
6266|Joey|yeah well we should order some food then.|0|5000000

6270|Joey|ah yeahwait a second now!|7|1001210
6271|Joey|look were gonna have to set a spending limit on the date.|0|4000100
6272|Joey|i dont have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.|7|2010200
6273|Ross|well sorry, thats what i do on dates.|0|4000100
6274|Joey|all right, well i guess ill just have to do what i do on dates.|0|3010100

6276|Joey|yeah. uh, a slicesix dollars?|0|5000000

6375|Ross|ill tell you who it hurts!|4|0000500
6376|Ross|it hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principals office wearing nothing but a catchers mitt!|4|0000302
6377|Rachel|that was|0|4000010
6378|Ross|i will be! listen, i dont want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. okay?|4|0000500
6380|Rachel|fine, but ill have you know that once i taught him that stuff he called me fun aunt rachel.|7|0210200
6381|Rachel|and i loved being fun aunt rachel but ill go back to being boring and uncomfortable aunt rachel if thats what you want!|7|0010202
6382|Ross|no thats not what i want. uh, im glad you guys were bonding but i|0|4001000
6383|Rachel|look he doesnt have any brothers or sisters, somebodys gonna have to teach him this stuff!|7|2001101
6384|Rachel|and i havent taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesnt know anyway!|7|2001101
6385|Ben|crap!!|4|0000311
6386|Rachel|i gotta go!|0|3011000

6399|Rachel|well, i feel fine, but i think youre bumming out the rest of the kids.|7|1110101
6403|Rachel|i realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids.|7|2100002
6404|Rachel|all i really needed was a plan.|0|4100000
6405|Rachel|see i wanna have three kids|0|4100000
6406|Phoebe|oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.|7|1000022
6407|Rachel|as i was saying i should probably have the first of the three kids by the time im 35 which gives me five years.|0|3100100
6408|Rachel|i love this plan!|1|0400010
6409|Rachel|i wanna marry this plan!|1|0400010

6413|Ross|oh yeah? what are you gonna do?|7|1100210
6414|Joey|i dont know.|0|3020000

6416|Joey|yknow what ross? im not gonna let you get away with this!|4|0100400

6426|Ross|dad, we-we cant believe youre selling the house.|2|0050000
6427|Mr. Geller|well, its time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.|0|5000000
6428|Ross|lets grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.|0|3011000
6429|Mr. Geller|im sorry we cant store your childhood things anymore.|2|0050000
6430|Monica|oh, thats okay, i cant wait to see everything again! all of the memories|1|0310010
6431|Mr. Geller|well, i dont know whats in the boxes down here, but i do know there are six or seven|0|4000010
6432|Monica|i used to|0|5000000
6433|Ross|yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.|0|4000001
6434|Monica|hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a|0|3000020
6435|Ross|ok, got the vent open.|0|5000000
6436|Phoebe|hi, i'm ben. i'm hospital worker ben. it's ben... to the rescue!|1|0300020
6437|Ross|ben, you ready?|0|4000010

6442|Susan|what do you see?|0|4000010
6443|Phoebe|well, susan, i see what appears to be a dark vent. wait. yes, it is in fact a dark vent.|0|4000001
6444|Ross|phoebs, it's open! it's open!|5|0100040
6445|Janitor|wait! you forgot your legs!|5|0001040
6446|Mr. Posner|you have a very impressive resume, ms. green. i especially like what i see here about implementing a new filing system.|1|2300000
6448|Joanna|filing system?|0|3000020
6450|Joanna|you mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders?|0|3100010
6451|Joanna|it certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.|1|2300000
6452|Rachel|well, they uh, they-they do more than that.|0|4000001
6453|Mrs. Lynch|i notice that youve been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.|0|4000010
6454|Rachel|yes, joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.|1|1400000
6455|Joanna|oh. and rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. its amazing how she gets it right almost|1|1300001
6456|Rachel|i-i-i of course, i have more responsibilities than that.|0|3001010
6457|Joanna|oh yes, well theres the coffee too.  rachel can carry two things at once!|7|2100011
6458|Mr. Posner|yes, thats very good. now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.|0|5000000
6459|Rachel|yes, i realize that|0|4000001
6460|Joanna|and rachel shouldnt have any problem with that. the only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what i mean.|0|3100001
6461|Rachel|i love working with designers!|1|1400000
6462|Joanna|with them, under them, whats the difference? eh, rach?|0|3100100
6463|Rachel|chandler, you have an assistant right?|0|5000000
6464|Chandler|did she call? you-you told her i was sick right? always tell her i am sick!|3|0014000
6465|Monica|chandler, listen to me sweetie, i know you can do this. okay? you have a beautiful smile.|0|3200000
6466|Chandler|i do?|5|1000040
6467|Monica|yeah!  all right, maybe you dont have to smile. lets try something else. lets try umm, try looking sexy.|0|3100010
6469|Monica|or not.|0|3000002
6471|Chandler|here i am.|0|4100000
6472|Phoebe|wash your hands!!!|6|0000014
6473|Chandler|how did youknow?|5|1000040
6474|Ross|hey! what's she doing back here?|5|0000140
6475|Monica|relax, ross. she's not made of ice cream!|0|3100010
6476|Ross|hey look, phoebe. i, uh, i laid out the states geographically...|0|4001000
6477|Monica|what happened in atlantic city?!|5|2000030
6478|Ross|well, chandler and i are in a bar|0|5000000
6479|Chandler|"did you not hear me say, ""du-ude?!"""|7|1001120
6480|Ross|and this girl is making eyes at chandler, okay?|0|4001000
6481|Ross|so after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, i see them kissing.|0|3110000
6482|Ross|now, i know what youre thinking, chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and youre right, chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out withgirls.|7|2210000
6483|Monica|you kissed a guy?!! oh my god.|5|0000041
6484|Chandler|in my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.|7|2000102
6485|Ross|oh mon, i laughed so hard|1|0500000
6486|Chandler|ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?|7|1200101
6487|Ross|whatever dude, you kissed a guy.|0|3100001
6488|Rachel|so umm, youre gonna stay with me as long as i need you?|0|3002000
6489|Mrs. Green|of course i am!|7|2200010
6490|Rachel|oh mom, i swear im not an idiot.|0|4010000
6491|Rachel|ive read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but i-i just didnt think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes.|0|4010000
6492|Rachel|and-and then guess what?|0|4010000
6493|Rachel|the babys coming and i dont know what to do.|7|1012010
6494|Rachel|oh, can i throw up in my diaper genie?|7|1021001
6495|Mrs. Green|no. sweetie, youre gonna be fine.|0|5000000
6496|Rachel|wait-wait where are you going? where are you going?|7|2002010
6497|Mrs. Green|im going to the bathroom.|0|5000000
6499|Mrs. Green|now dont worry! everythings gonna be okay.|0|3200000
6500|Monica|it|0|5000000
6502|Phoebe|hey! why are you all red and sweaty?|7|1100021
6503|Ross|i just bamboozled chandler!  which is not uh sexual thing. that was a quick shower.|0|3200000
6504|Phoebe|not if you were here.|0|5000000
6505|Monica|okay, the reason why i asked you guys out to brunch today is because i have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.|0|3002000
6506|Rachel|oh my god! this is it!   i really hope its you!|1|0400010
6507|Phoebe|i hope its you.|0|4000010
6509|Monica|first of all um, i love you both so much and youre both so important to me|7|2201000
6510|Rachel|okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! who is it?!|7|1201100
6511|Monica|well umm, i was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other.|0|5000000
6512|Monica|like hypothetically, if phoebe were mine|0|5000000
6513|Phoebe|yes!!! oh!!|1|0400010
6514|Rachel|hypothetically!|7|1102010
6515|Phoebe|still.|0|5000000
6516|Monica|if phoebe were my maid of honor|0|4001000
6517|Rachel|uh-hmm.|0|5000000
6518|Monica|rachel would be phoebes, i would be rachels, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.|0|5000000
6519|Rachel|yeah thats actually a pretty good idea.|0|3200000
6520|Phoebe|yeah, ill do that. so who gets to be yours?|0|4000010
6521|Monica|well thats the best part. umm,|0|4001000
6522|Phoebe|wh-why is that the best part?|5|1000040
6523|Monica|because then i dont have to!|1|0400010
6524|Rachel|well of|0|4010000
6525|Monica|im really not deciding!|7|2201000

6830|Joey|no, no, my mouth    says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!|0|3101000
6831|Ross|ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, monet is not spelt    m-o-n-a-y.|0|4100000

6833|Ross|i wrote that out phonetically for you.|0|5000000
6834|Joey|phonetically?|0|3000020
6835|Ross|yeah, yeah that means... you know? we just... we don't have time    for this.|0|4010000
6837|Ross|ok, but you know what? i gotta say, i'm really impressed that    you were able to memorize all this so quickly!|5|0000050
6838|Joey|"ah! i'm an actor! i can memorize anything! last week on ""days""    i had to say ""frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy""."|7|1200020
6839|Ross|wow. what does|5|1000040
6840|Joey|no idea!|7|2200010
6841|Joey|"but the guy i said it to dies in the next scene so i    guess it means ""you're gonna get eaten by a bear""."|7|1010021
6842|Ross|ok! so let's move on to the renaissance?|0|3100010

7937|Chandler|i know this isn't the kind of thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, i think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.|1|1400000
7938|Chandler|anyway, i was just thinking, i mean, if you'd gone to vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?|7|1210010
7939|Chandler|so i guess what i'm trying to say is that i'm very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked.|1|1400000

8448|Chandler|a woman named heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.|0|3000020
8449|Monica|honey, we were at this beautiful place, and i-i-i just put our names down for fun!|7|2102000

8452|Monica|chandler, please dont think i was trying to pressure you. phoebe and rachel|7|2012000
8453|Chandler|phoebe and rachel!|7|1101110

8469|Rachel|you cannot get the phone that way; thats not fair!|4|0000401
8470|Rachel|okay look, i have an idea.|0|4000100
8471|Rachel|why dont we, why dont we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him.|0|3001100
8472|Rachel|and then whoever does gets the phone.|0|4000100
8473|Phoebe|or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.|0|5000000
8474|Rachel|i dont think so.|7|1000211
8475|Phoebe|fine all right, but id bet youd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.|4|2000300
8476|Rachel|all right, first name on the speed dial is mom.|0|3000110
8477|Phoebe|ohh, i lost my mom to suicide.|2|0050000

8626|Phoebe|what?! why?!|5|0000050
8627|Ross|because! because, it-it-its itd be like you having this guitar  and-and never playing it. okay, this guitar|4|1000400
8628|Phoebe|all right. if you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.|4|0000401

8631|Mona|how could you have kept all of this from me?|7|0110111
8632|Ross|i was going to tell you, but|0|5000000
8633|Dr. Green|but what?! you figured youd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped rachel!|4|0000311

8637|Joey|everything on your application looks really goodohh!|1|0500000
8638|Joey|just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?|7|2002010
8639|The Potential Roommate|oh dont worry, im not really a party girl.|0|4000010
8640|Joey|whoa!! now look, dont be just blurtin stuff out. i want you to really think about your answers. okay?|7|2001020
8641|Chandler|you can call off the roommate search!  hi! ill be living here.|1|0500000
8642|Joey|oh dont listen to him, hes just some guy who really wants the apartment, but i dont think hes gonna get it.|7|2000102
8643|Chandler|why did you take the shower curtain down?|5|1000040
8644|Joey|that thing was a hazard!  im very safety conscious.|3|0003110
8646|Chandler|hey man, how did the audition go?|0|5000000
8647|Joey|estelle said i didn't get it.|2|1040000
8648|Rachel|what?! why? joey you were so ready for it!|5|0010040
8649|Joey|yeah, i thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.|7|1020110
8651|Ross|for all i know, shes trying to find me but couldnt because i kept moving around.|0|3011000
8652|Ross|no, from now on, im staying in one place.|0|4000001
8653|Ross|right here.|0|4000001
8654|Monica|well, its getting late.|0|5000000
8655|Chandler|yeah, were gonna go.|0|5000000
8656|Ross|actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?|0|4001000
8657|Monica|ugh, yknow, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for new york.|0|3000002
8658|Chandler|yeah, its a very large plane.|0|5000000
8659|Ross|thats cool.|0|4010000
8660|Chandler|but, well stay here with you.|0|4000001
8661|Ross|thanks guys!  i really appreciate this, yknow, but you dont have to rub my butt.|1|0300020
8662|Phoebe|hey, mel gibson and clint eastwood.|5|2000030
8663|Ross|theyre not a couple!|5|0000131
8664|Phoebe|oh-okay, i get the game now.|0|4000010
8665|Joey|okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?|0|3100010
8666|Ross|oh yeah!|1|1400000
8667|Joey|well okay, so then youre fine.|0|5000000
8668|Joey|the rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone.|0|5000000
8670|Joey|so as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about.|0|5000000
8671|Joey|its when the heat goes away, thats when youre in trouble.|0|5000000
8673|Joey|look, you guys have been to every play ive ever been in, have i ever had chemistry on stage?|0|3001001
8675|Joey|noooo!!|0|3010100
8676|Phoebe|ursula!  wait! err-err, its me! phoebe!|5|0101030
8677|Ursula|oh, i thought there was a mirror there. okay, bye-bye.|0|3000011
8678|Phoebe|wait a second! so, whats new with you?|5|2000030
8679|Ursula|umm, nothing. i mean, im getting married next week.|0|3101000
8680|Jim|and your breasts! hmm!!!|5|0000050
8682|Phoebe|umm look, youre coming on a little strong.|7|2000120
8683|Phoebe|but im going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together.|0|4100000
8684|Phoebe|so, why dont we just start over okay?|0|5000000
8685|Phoebe|and you can just tell me about yourself.|0|5000000
8688|Jim|i write erotic novels, for children.|0|4100000
8690|Jim|theyre wildly unpopular.|0|4010000

8883|Chandler|wait! youre going out with kathy!|5|0000131
8884|Joey|yeah. why are you getting so upset?|5|1000040
8885|Chandler|well, im upsetfor you. i mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.|6|0010103
8886|Joey|what is the big deal? its not like were exclusive.|7|2000120
8887|Chandler|look, joey, kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs.|7|2010002
8888|Chandler|but casey, i mean granted i only saw the back of her head, but i got this sense that shes-shes smart, and funny, and gets you.|0|4010000
8889|Joey|you got all that from the back of her head?|5|1000040
8890|Chandler|all right look, i think its time for you to settle down. y'know? make a choice, pick a lane.|0|4010000

8896|Joey|one!  no ten! you said ten! you cant take that back!|4|0100310
8899|Chandler|listen, can we watch cartoons on your television?|0|4001000

8902|Rachel|well, so, why dont you just turn it off?|7|1000022

9988|Rachel|you really think it would be that different?|5|0000050
9989|Phoebe|how could it not be?|5|1000040
9990|Phoebe|i mean pretty soon theyre gonna be having kids, and then theyre just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.|2|1040000
9991|Phoebe|and then maybe theyre gonna have to leave the city to be near a|2|1040000
9992|Rachel|well, things change.|0|3010100

9995|Rachel|its still there!|5|0000140
9996|Chandler|mrs. braverman must be out.|0|4000010
9997|Rachel|she could be out of town. maybe shell be gone for months.|7|2002010
9998|Chandler|by then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. we dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake.|3|1003001
9999|Rachel|no that could kill her.|3|1003001
10000|Chandler|well, we dont want that.|0|3011000
10001|Rachel|no, so were protecting her.|0|3101000
10002|Chandler|but we should take it.|0|4100000
10003|Rachel|but we should move quick.|7|2102000
10005|Rachel|because i think i just heard her moving around in there.|7|1002020
10006|Chandler|go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go!|3|0004010
10007|Chandler|hey, kicky. what're you doing?|0|4000010

10009|Chandler|well, you're gonna.|0|5000000
10010|Joey|i've been thinking. y'know, about how i'm always seeing girls on top of girls...|0|5000000
10011|Chandler|are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?|0|3200000
10012|Joey|y'know what i mean, about how i'm always going out with all these women.|0|4000100
10013|Joey|and i always figured, when the right one comes along, i'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know?|7|2020010
10014|Joey|now i'm looking at my dad, thinking...|0|3020000
10015|Chandler|hey, you're not him.|0|3000110
10016|Chandler|you're you.|0|5000000
10017|Chandler|when they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?|0|4000100
10020|Chandler|you decided to go into the out-of-work actor business.|0|3100001
10021|Chandler|now that wasn't easy, but you did it!|7|2100020
10022|Chandler|"and i'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say ""no thanks, i'm married."""|0|3200000
10023|Joey|you really think so?|7|2010020
10024|Chandler|yeah. i really do.|0|3200000
10025|Joey|thanks, chandler.|0|3200000

10028|The Cooking Teacher|your fettuccini alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?|0|4000001
10029|Joey|when you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?|0|4000010
10030|The Cooking Teacher|and the cream?|0|3000011
10031|Joey|cheese makes me thirsty.|0|5000000

10034|The Cooking Teacher|oh! something smells good over at monicas station!  oh my god! this is absolutely amazing! youve never made this before?|5|0100040
10035|Monica|oh no!|5|0101030
10036|Monica|i dont know anything about cooking.|0|3100010
10037|Monica|i had to ask someone what its called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.|0|4000010
10038|The Cooking Teacher|well, hats off to the chef.|1|1300010
10039|Monica|i-i-im sorry, your-your mouth was full, i didnt hear what you said. umm, hats off to who now?|0|3100010
10040|The Cooking Teacher|the chef!|1|0400010
10044|Monica|how's it going?|0|5000000
10045|Phoebe|good. oh oh! roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.|7|2100020
10046|Phoebe|so what's going on?|0|5000000
10047|Monica|nothing, um, it's just, um... it's roger.|0|3011000
10048|Ross|i dunno, there's just something about...|0|3002000
10049|Chandler|basically we just feel that he's...|0|3001001
10050|Rachel|we hate that guy.|6|1000103
10051|All|yeah. hate him.|6|1000103
10052|Ross|we're sorry, pheebs, we're sorry.|2|1040000
10055|Phoebe|okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?|0|4000010
10056|All|...no, we hate him.|6|1000103
10057|Rachel|we're sorry.|2|1040000
10061|Joey|im sending back all this stuff that chandler bought out of guilt.|0|3010001
10062|Chandler|yes that was mine.|7|2020100
10063|Joey|'cause i figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.|7|1001012
10064|Chandler|yes that would have made more sense.|7|2010200
10065|Joey|y'know, i-i don't even feel like i know you anymore man!|4|0000311
10066|Joey|all right, look, i'm just gonna ask you this one time.|0|3000101
10067|Joey|and whatever you say, i'll believe ya.|0|3000101
10068|Joey|were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?|7|1000112
10070|Chandler|oh hey! there's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?|7|1200110
10071|Ross|hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, gonna need stitches ball.|7|2100200
10072|Ross|she said what?|5|1000040
10073|Emily|"she said, ""if im not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."""|0|3011000
10074|Ross|postpone it?|7|1011020
10075|Ross|emily, do you think monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding?|7|2000201
10076|Ross|do you my sisters teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?|7|1000202
10077|Ross|this isnt right.|0|3010001
10078|Emily|i realize that people are going to be disappointed. but, im sure theyll come back when we can do it right.|7|2021000
10079|Ross|i cant ask people to do that? would you ask people to do that?|7|1010102
10080|Emily|dont you point your pants at me!|4|1000310
10081|Emily|we have no choice!|4|1000400
10082|Emily|anywhere thats half-decent wouldve be booked months ago, ross dont you understand?|7|2011001
10083|Emily|this is our wedding im talking about.|7|1022000
10084|Ross|the only thing i understand is; postponing it is not an option. this is when were getting married.|0|4000100
10085|Emily|so what are you saying? its now or never?|7|1002110
10086|Ross|no. im saying its now.|0|3000200
10087|Emily|or?|7|2012000
10088|Ross|theres no or in mind. what is wrong with these pants?!!|7|1000220
10089|Emily|its not the pants.|7|2000102
10090|Emily|its you that is backwards.|7|1100102
10091|Emily|and if, and if you dont understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldnt get married at all!|4|1000400
10092|Ross|no, wait! emily! no, wait, stop! emily, please|2|1031000
10093|Monica|hi, honey.|0|3200000
